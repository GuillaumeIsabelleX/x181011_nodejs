# x181011_nodejs
#@x 1810110831 for my mastery of NodeJS/ExpressJS.  I Intend to experiment with ROUTE, get the QUERY string, grab POST request in an object.  ALso, I would like to learn how EXPRESS (if that could) be helpful in creatinng USER INTERFACES (@v I Want an Optimal Framework to build UI)

* @A 1810110831a Explore ExpressJS, Annotate discovery and further goal
* @A 1810110831b Extend my knowledge of ROUTE in NodeJS/ExpressJS (is there any advantage for routing in Express or is it only part of NodeJS itself)
* @A 1810110831s Socket.IO, can this be part of this, combine Socket.IO and ExpressJS (an event triggered by realtime collaborator publishes and event with data that we receive and use ExpressJS capabilities to do something appreciable visually (if any capabilities are discovered within the ExpressJS+USER INTERFACE...
* @A 1810110831d [Dockerize][] Dockerize the whole experimentation.
* @v 1810110831H Have Fun !
